# Devlog 1

Just a project to entertain myself with. To be honest, I don't know how far I'll take this; it might just be a small thing I do during school. I know my pal Keegan C's making the art, so that'll be nice. I gotta learn a lot of stuff before this takes off. At least I have minecraft alpha to copy off of.

My guess: eventually I'll forget how to type capital letters if i let the computer-style devlog typing carry me to far...

# Devlog 2

I've gotten the hang of it; sort of. I've coded on intellij a few times before, and am definitely more used to the workflow here; it's much better than the one on repl.it anyway, I should only use that one for python. 

I changed the name, source, and file structure of the code; now it's much more neat, readable, compressible, and runnable; the whole package. I'm currently watching my neighbor have a stroke on a flight simulator now instead of coding, brb.

Ok I'm bacc. I've gotten an idea on game design: platformer based on daydreaming; perhaps the character can enter a parallel stage at will dependent on position? Will definitely confer with a friend before, but first I should develop a stable graphics environment.

# Devlog 3

At this point, I've gotten an idea on how to make and manage most things; I'm still gettign the hang of git; that's going well. I'm still working on the flowchart for everything. I think I'm going to have each object separate from the images resource, but have a local cache for anything that's called a bunch.

Ok, I think I've gotten much of the object structure down. I included native listeners for things like other classes broadcasting messages and such. It's a really abstract structure, but I think that's the point of it.

# Devlog 4

It's coming together. Keegan deployed his master artistic skills and made several sprites, one of which I have updated to be my profile pic.

Dang, today's assignment was mildly painful. I had to re-re-learn the tkinter python library several times just to get a variable out of a function. Anyways, I'm gonna try out my other java repo I use for learning.

# Devlog 5

Progress is going smoothly. I've gotten the hang of certain parts of the java.awt and javax.swing library. I've also learned about *italics*, **bold**, and ~~cross-out~~ markings in the .md format, learned that as of 30 seconds of me writing this. Anyways, I'm gonna try to implement the thing's I've been learning in my tests repo here, I'll be right back.

And I am back. I have officially migrated the image rendering software from my tests repo to this one. Hopefully I'll get the internet access required to commit these changes. I added a scroll bar and some name formatting from the tests repo here for good measure. I have high hopes for what is to come; I hope I don't get too excited, just in case.

# Devlog 6

Short one this time. All I did was reformat the images a bit and get a start on the sprite stuff, getting some basic constants and such going.

# Devlog 7

This time I learned about the <code>code</code> tag. I wonder how many other features from HTML there is in this file format. Let's try:

<p style="color:black;background:aqua">Well it does colors alright. I might go ahead an make this into a format...</p>

Or not. Anyways, I'm working on the sprites now.

I refactored ***end***

I've started a different kind of workflow here: because most of my school takes up a lot of time, including various extra-curricular activities, I usually extend these logs across days; for example, I'm going to pick up on this log tomorrow in computer science class. The reason I got so little done today was because I forgot to commit the day before. I can't use <code>ssh-agent</code> at school because of the stupid administration policies, which is mildly frustrating. Anyways, I'll pick up tomorrow.

Indeed I did pick up in that specified day. I think I made a lot of progress: I started finalizing the basic sprite and entity structure and I attempted to test it in a refactored main class.

Oh my goodness, I'm been forced to watch "What the Health" in health class. It's absolute garbage: *Countries who consume more dairy products also seem to have higher cancer rates; therefore, dairy products cause cancer.* What bullcrap. As a 10 year old I understood the difference between correlation and causation: obviously countries who consume more milk have more infrastructure to produce said milk, which requires a larger population, which in turn increases the number of cancer cases. Also there are too many outside factors to consider: access to antibodies, GMOs, and other technologies. While I agree with the greenhouse gas emmisions, it doesn't do this point justice by offering a clear-cut solution. Goodness.

Some time recently, I decided to try my hand at LWJGL and OpenGL, and I split this log into another branch attached to that project. While I don't intend to remove that project, I think I should experiment with Java2D before going into that kind of low-level stuff. First thing to do: get Java2D working.

Easier than expected. Turns out it's just a part of java awt. Tonight, all I could get done was drawing a line with the mouse interactively (which considering the small amount of stuff I've done in the past few weeks over several libraries, I'm impressed), and next I intend to add some more painting functionalities like free-flow curves and lines. I'll pick up tomorrow.

I guess I did. Today we had a project in computer science class today, so I couldn't work on this then. However, I finished that project rather quickly; it was supposed to last a week long, so now I get plenty of time to work on this. I got free-flow curves to work, I just need to fix a small bug with it.
